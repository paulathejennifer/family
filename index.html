    <p>To the world you are a mother <br>,To this family you are the world.
        <br>
        The rock and fortress of Us.
        <br>She builds,She serves,She leads.
    <br>
    My closest companion and friend. <br>The one i knew before i could even see the world itself. <br>You have a kind heart and soul. May God keep you and Bless you Sweet Mom.
</p>
<p><h3>ROONEY</h3>
There is no buddy like a brother.
 <br>
Although sometimes he teases and ignores me and i get hurt <br>no one can ever take his place in my heart. <br>He is my laughter in sadness and my balance in intensity.
<br>
A brother is a gift given by Nature.
</p>
<p><h3>JENNIFER</h3>
All i can say is that i am more than blessed for my fortress which is my family. <br>
A lot of people out there are lost and broken because of lack of family connections, betrayal and abandonment but God gave it to me with both hands. <br>
We connect alot and i think every Human Being deserves that from the time you see the world till eternity.</p>
